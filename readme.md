# BurgerQuest

## Work-in-progress notes

* Mark committed a yeoman project (http://yeoman.io), if you've got node & yeoman installed you should be able to run the grunt server, but I'm not 100% on the best practice re having a project in the repo.
* Have added dummy JSON in burgerService.js, currently there's no persistence or backend.
